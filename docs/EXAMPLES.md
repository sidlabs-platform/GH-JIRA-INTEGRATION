**Result:**
- 1 Jira issue created in project `SEC` (default)
- No user story link (none provided)
- Labels: `github-security-alert`, `missing-user-story`, `severity-critical`, `repo-myapp`, `code-scanning`

---

commit 3: refactor: update database schema [AUTH-102]
```

**PR description:**
```markdown
# Authentication Module

Implements complete authentication flow.
```

**Code scanning finds:**

**Result:**
- 1 Jira issue created
- Linked to `AUTH-100` (first found in commits)
- Labels: `github-security-alert`, `severity-high`, `repo-myapp`, `code-scanning`

---

### Scenario 4: Secret Scanning Alert

**Secret scanning detects:**

- Labels: `github-security-alert`, `severity-critical`, `secret-scanning`, `repo-myapp`
- Remote link back to GitHub secret scanning alert
- Slack/Teams notification sent (if configured)

---

### Scenario 5: Dependabot Alert with Dedup

**Dependabot detects:**
- Prototype Pollution in lodash < 4.17.21 (High severity)

**First run result:**
- 1 Jira issue created: `[Dependabot] Prototype Pollution in lodash`
- Labels include `dedup-{sha256hash}`, `dependabot`

**Second run (same alert):**
- Duplicate detected via JQL search for `dedup-{sha256hash}` label
- Skipped — no new Jira issue created
- Log: `Duplicate found: SEC-100, skipping`

---

### Scenario 6: Severity Filtering

**Configuration:** `JIRA_MIN_SEVERITY=high`

**Code scanning finds:**
- SQL injection (Critical) → ✅ Issue created
- XSS (High) → ✅ Issue created
- Missing CSRF token (Medium) → ❌ Filtered out
- Info disclosure (Low) → ❌ Filtered out

**Result:** 2 of 4 alerts create Jira issues

- Include user story in footer
- Write clear, descriptive messages
- Reference Jira issue consistently

❌ **DON'T:**

## 📈 Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Alert Creation Rate**
   - Number of security alerts per PR
   - Trend over time

2. **User Story Linkage Rate**
   - Percentage with user stories vs. fallback
   - Improvement over time

3. **Resolution Time**
   - Time from alert creation to resolution
   - By severity level

4. **False Positive Rate**
   - Alerts closed as false positives
   - By rule type

### Example Jira JQL Queries

```jql
// All security alerts from GitHub
labels = "github-security-alert"

// Alerts without user stories
labels = "missing-user-story" AND labels = "github-security-alert"

// High severity alerts
labels = "severity-high" AND labels = "github-security-alert"

// Alerts by repository
labels = "repo-myapp" AND labels = "github-security-alert"

// Unresolved critical alerts
labels = "severity-critical" AND labels = "github-security-alert" AND status != Done

// Duplicate detection check
project = SEC AND labels = "dedup-abc123def456"

// Secret scanning alerts
labels = "secret-scanning" AND labels = "github-security-alert"

// Dependabot alerts
labels = "dependabot" AND labels = "github-security-alert"
```
